# Magic Swords

Everyone loves a good magic sword.
:
Whether you're a far traveler who picked up a strange artifact on your explorations, a noble from an ancient lineage with heirloom weaponry, or a tinkerer who wants to make their mark, magic swords are the bread and butter of fantasy magic items.

::
### SWORDTEMBER
This year, I participated in Swordtember on Bluesky, a challenge to draw a sword based on a different theme every day for 30 days. I didn't do all of them, but using the prompts below, I sketched a few and converted them into some digital drawings and magic items for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

### Wave Warden

*Weapon (rapier), very rare, requires attunement*

2 lbs.
:
This spiraling blade is reminiscent of a hermit-crab shell, with a scallop-shell design protecting the wielder's hand. It carries the scent and sound of the ocean within its seemingly hollow interior.

This weapon has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Once per long rest, the wielder may summon the strength of the ocean and use their action to cast *Tidal Wave* from the sword without any material components.

Anyone attuned to this blade gains a swim speed of 30 feet and can breath underwater.

##### Faithful
Cleric's Aide
}}
:::::::::::::::

### Spellbane
*Weapon (longsword), rare, requires attunement*

10 lbs.
:
This retractible longsword can be attached as a prosthetic, integrated into a construct, or gripped in the hand. Each row of lights on the hilt (or shoulder attachment in the case of a construct or prosthesis) indicate the power levels stored within.

This sword's blade can be retracted or extended like a switch blade with a bonus action. It can be used like a *Ring of Spell-storing*, containing up to 5 levels of spells that anyone attuned to the sword may cast using the original caster's spellcasting ability for attacks and saves and following the normal rules of the spell.

Alternatively, the wielder may use their reaction when a creature they can see within 30 feet casts a spell to absorb it, as long as they have slots available to match the level of the spell cast. If the spell being cast is of a higher level than slots available in the sword, the spell is cast as normal and the reaction is still expended. Any spell slots absorbed in this way are temporarily consumed until the end of the wielder's next long rest, when the energy is turned into 5 temporary Hit Points per spell level.

##### Wave Warden
the Shell Sword
}}
:::::::::::::::::::::
### Faithful
*Weapon (dagger), uncommon*

1 lb.
:
This golden-handled dagger has 9 rubies in a v-formation on the curve of the bell-shaped crossguard. It can also be used as a handbell, tinkling with light musicality as the wielder wishes.

This dagger deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. 
The wielder can use their action to cast *Toll the Dead* as though they were 11th level.

##### Bezel & Sweep
The Hands of Time
}}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Prisoner's Blade
*Weapon (dagger), uncommon*

5 lb.
:
Shiv-like in its origins, this double-pronged bone blade was intentionally carved to deal severe damage to internal organs. The rat-tooth-shaped points bring to mind the very critters that keep lonely prisoners company.

This dagger deals an extra 2d4 piercing damage. It crits on a 19 or 20.

##### Halation
the Illuminated Guisarme
}}

\column
### Bezel (javelin) & Sweep (dagger)
*Weapons (javelin and dagger), legendary, requires attunement*

5 lb.
:
This short spear and dagger set can be attached at the handle to form a long double-bladed spear with a reach of 15 feet, known as the Hands of Time. Made of dark metal and wrapped in thin coils of wire, these blades will cut any life short.

These blades have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. They share a combined 10 charges that may be used to enable various abilities. The blades regain 1d6+1 charges every dawn. If you ever expend all 10 charges, the blades' magic becomes inert and they become nonmagical +2 weapons.

**Mainspring (Sweep):** As a bonus action, the wielder may expend up to 4 charges to deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage per charge expended on the next successful attack made with Sweep (the dagger).

**Windup (Bezel):** As part of a ranged attack with Bezel (the javelin), the wielder may expend a charge to double the short and long range of the weapon. This charge also allows the wielder to recall the weapon immediately after throwing it.

**Time Out (Hands of Time):** As an action when the blades are combined, the wielder may expend 9 charges to cast Time Stop.

##### Prisoner's Blade
the Rattooth Dagger
}}
:::::::::
### Halation, The Illuminated Guisarme
*Weapon (longsword), rare*

5 lb.
:
With a polearm-like blade, this sword stabs and slashes without mercy. With golden leaves on the crossguard, greenery climbing the hilt, and a flexible webbing of stained-glass built to encase the wielder's hand, the sword is ornate and elegant.

This blade deals an extra 2d6 piercing damage.

**Hypnotic Strike:** Once per long rest, on a successful attack, the wielder may force their target to make a Wisdom saving throw, DC 15. On a failure, the creature is charmed, *incapacitated,* and has a speed of 0 for 1 minute. It can repeat the save at the end of each turn to end the effect early.

### The Seer's Lodestone
*Weapon (great sword), rare, requires attunement*

10 lb.
:
Grown from natural quartz, this crystalline blade is cracked and jagged, with multicolored minerals bringing a rainbow hue to the weapon, including its transluscent hilt and crossguard.

**Crystallomancy:** Once per long rest, the wielder may use the sword as a spellcasting focus and cast *Scry* without any material components.

**Transmute Elements:** As a reaction when an ally or enemy you can see within 30 feet casts a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can change that damage to another type listed.

##### Fathom
the Vapor Sword
}}
::::::::::::::::::::

### Shrieker
*Weapon (great sword), rare*

10 lb.
:
This huge triangular blade was wielded by titans. The circular cutouts in the steel sing of the target's death as it whistles through the air. The grip is made of amber-like beads and the basket hilt is shaped like interlocking golden rings.

This blade deals an extra 1d6 thunder damage.

**Whistle:** On a successful hit, the wielder may force the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be deafened until the end of their next turn. This ability may be used 3 times per long rest.

### Fathom
*Weapon (shortsword), uncommon, requires attunement*

5 lb.
:
This thick curved sword drips water from a constant source of condensation. Its creator etched a wave-like pattern on the blade, and three green knobs adorn the crossguard and hilt.

* *Warding Wind* (but water instead of wind)
* *Wall of Water*

### Perennial, the Changeling Blade
*Weapon (longsword), rare, requires attunement*

5 lb.
:
This broadsword is standard issue at first glance, but has the ability to change forms and powers at the will of the wielder. After any long rest, the wielder may change which form the sword takes.

**Spring:** In Spring, the sword becomes covered in vines and blooming things. As a bonus action, the wielder can cast *Grasping Vine* and *Entangle* once each per long rest.

**Summer:** In Summer, the sword glows with a bright light that cannot be dimmed. It sheds 60 feet of bright light and another 60 feet of dim light. All the sword's typical damage becomes radiant damage. Twice per long rest, the wielder may choose to deal an extra 2d6 fire damage on an attack.

**Autumn:** In Autumn, the blade greens crossguard and triangular eyes glow from the hilt. The wielder gains 60 feet of darkvision (120 feet if they already have darkvision), and advantage on all Stealth and Intimidation checks.

**Winter:** In Winter, the blade grows cold and covered in icicles. All the sword's typical damage becomes cold damage. Once per long rest, the wielder may force all creatures within 15 feet (including themselves) to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 5d8 bludgeoning and 5d8 cold damage and are knocked prone as the icicles explode. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.
